# COVID-Prediction
COVID Prediction using ARIMA model and FB Prophet
Utilizing the comprehensive capabilities of the Prophet and ARIMA library in
Python, we aim to comprehend and forecast concerning trends in COVID-19 cases, a
highly transmissible disease primarily spread among humans. By harnessing pandasâ€™
functionalities, we can efficiently import and visualize CSV data containing relevant
COVID-19 information while employing its extensive suite of functions for dataset
cleaning to ensure accuracy. Through thorough analysis, including identifying key
metrics and demographic factors influencing transmission, we can gain insights into
the dynamics of the pandemic. With a clean dataset in hand, statistical models and
machine learning algorithms can be employed to forecast future trends, aiding in
the development of informed strategies for mitigation and response.
